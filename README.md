## LMMS with Timbres of Heaven

You can grab [LMMS](https://lmms.io) to make audio tracks. It ships with a couple of drums that you might like. Beyond that, you can grab the excellent soundfont [Timbres of Heaven](http://midkar.com/soundfonts/) (bottom of the page, 300MB). It contains lots and lots of excellent audio samples; the ones I tried are listed below:
