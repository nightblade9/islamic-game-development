# Islamic Game Development

Quite a few people ask me about the ins and outs of making games, islamically. Here are some resources.

# Rulings on Making Games / Fatawa

Is it permissible to make Islamic games? I think so. I would go beyond saying it's merely permissible; I would argue that it's necessary to combat Islamophobia, and to make Muslims normalized as members of society - at least, in the perceptions of others.

What's more, as Muslims, we believe that entertainment (like all things) should be in moderaiton. I believe we have an obligation to make games non-addictive, and urge you to think about ways of doing this. (Hint: don't add things like bonuses if you log in every 3 hours.)

In terms of rulings, you may want to know about:

- [The well-known prohibition of drawing/animating living things](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39806/ruling-on-drawing-animate-beings)
- [The well-known prohibition on music and musical instruments](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5000/ruling-on-music-singing-and-dancing)
- [A brief opinion on beat-boxing](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1867/sounds-produced-by-mouth-which-sound-like-musical-instruments) and things that sound like music (they take the same ruling as music).
- [A fatwa about exclusions](https://islamqa.com/en/answers/10326/tv-and-movie-pictures-and-video-pictures); in particular, it mentions (square-bracket add-ins are mine): "The first category [of pictures] is those which have no tangible substance (and can only be seen by running them through a machine), as I was told is the case with pictures on video tapes [and video games]. There is no ruling at all concerning these, and **they do not come under the prohibition at all.**"
- [An interesting answer](https://islam.stackexchange.com/a/24858) about the morality of making video games, and what might and might not be problematic (from an Islamic perspective)
- [An excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4MHV15n-Lw) about Muslim representation in video games, which also talks about why this matters

# Halal Music Alternatives

I follow the opinion that only vocals and drums (not precussion instruments in general) are permissible. Based on that, here are some resources that may be helpful to create "music" or nasheed-like audio.

## The Infinite Drum Machine

[The Infinite Drum Machine](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/drum-machine/view/) is an AI-driven audio maker. It layers together four different precussion instruments (you can customize from what seems like hundreds of samples) and generates a short audio loop.

## LMMS with Timbres of Heaven

You can grab [LMMS](https://lmms.io) to make audio tracks. It ships with a couple of drums that you might like. Beyond that, you can grab the excellent soundfont [Timbres of Heaven](http://midkar.com/soundfonts/) (bottom of the page, 300MB). It contains lots and lots of excellent audio samples; the ones I tried are listed below:

- 0:52    chior aahs
- 0:53    voice oohs
- 0:116   taiko drum
- 0:117   melodic drum
- 0:118   synth drum
- 0:123   bird tweets 
- 1:53    soul ooh
- 1:121   fl. key click
- 2:119   gong
- 3:123   bird 2
- 4:126   heartbeat
- 5:122   bubbles
- 5:126   footsteps
- 8:115   castanets
- 8:116   concert bass drum
- 8:117   melo tom 2
- 8:118   don's tom
- 32:52   choir aahs 2
- 64:0    cutting noise
- 64:1    cut 2
- 64:50   bird 2
- 64:66   door slam
- 64:*    lots of stuff, investigate
- 128     random sounds, investigate

## SoundScapes

One of the easiest ways to avoid the issue of music is to create a sound-scape; that is, a composition of background audios. For example, if you're making a JRPG with a forest location, you can add the background sound of trees in the wind and a babbling brook; you can add in the sounds of birds and other animals as you approach those locations. (This requires more creativity, but is definitely doable, for sci-fi and surreal environments.)

In terms of resources, there are many high-quality audio sources available:

- [Sonniss GDC Audios](https://sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc) are six packs of professional sound-effects, roughly 20GB each, available via torrent.
- [FreeSound](http://freesound.org) includes a huge array of sounds; just make sure you look for CC0 (or credit sound authors appropriately)
